            Web testing is a software testing practice to test websites or web applications for potential bugs. It’s a complete testing of web-based applications before making live.

            A web-based system needs to be checked completely from end-to-end before it goes live for end users.
            <br/>
            By performing website testing, an organization can make sure that the web-based system is functioning properly and can be accepted by real-time users.
            <br/>
            The UI design and functionality are the captains of website testing.
